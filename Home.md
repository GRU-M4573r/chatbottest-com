Welcome to the chatbottest collaborative guide!

This is an open source project by [@chus9000](https://twitter.com/chus9000), [@nieves_as](https://twitter.com/nieves_as) and [@Carlos_Munoz](https://twitter.com/Carlos_Munoz).

The ChatbotTest guide is a compilation of questions ordered under 7 different categories to test specific functionalities on chatbottest.

You can collaborate on the list by issuing any of the sections.

This work is under a creative commons license.

We used it to develop [Alma](http://chatbottest.com), a chrome extension that helps you test chatbots in Telegram.

Feel free to use the list on your own benefit.

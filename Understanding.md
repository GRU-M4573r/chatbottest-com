## Description

If the user is allowed to write anything that it wants, what elements is the chatbot capable to understand?

----

### Accepted inputs

**Instructions**

Send two messages in a row before the chatbot gives any answer (they need to make sense together). Maybe something like:

Hi!

I need [something under the chatbot's scope]	

**Questions**

Does the chatbot answer to both of them?

----

**Instructions**

Instead of using the proposed answers given by the chatbot try rephrasing them. For instance instead of answering a yes/no question with a yes/no answer say "It would be nice"

**Questions**

Does the chatbot understand you?

-----

**Instructions**

Skip steps. Conversations are generally crafted in flows, where the chatbots tries to get different pieces of information from you in order to be able to give you a better answer. Those different pieces of information are generally asked one by one. Try to skip steps by giving all the information needed in just one sentence. If it's a weather chatbot try something like: "what's the weather in Madrid tomorrow night" For a travel chatbot: Find me a flight from New York to Paris in November.
